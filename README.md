# glip-stock-bot

A stock quote bot for [Glip](https://glip.com/).

I created this project based on this [youtube video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67yifrwUNsw). If you don't know how to setup and run this project, please refer to that video.

I used the Glip message attachment API to make the bot produce beautiful messages.
